Before submitting a bug report against live-build, please make sure
that you have read your guidelines for live systems bug reports:

  http://live-systems.org/manual/

By providing the required information as outlined in the guidelines makes
sure that we can optimally reproduce and fix bugs, not doing so wastes a
lot of time for both the maintainers and the submitters.

Please keep in mind that bugs that lack the required information will
likely be ignored.
