    anyway.
  * Renaming local/scripts to local/bin for executables overriding not
    just lb scripts, but any command during live-build runs.

    for after wheezy.
  * Renaming config/binary_debian-installer to simply config/debian-
    installer.
  * Removing support for local grub/grub2 splash image and config
    manipulations, custom templates should be used instead. Rather than
    doing all the heavy lifting in live-build that nobody really uses
    and which is quite inflexible, users should (in line with the
    syslinux handling) either stick with the default grub
    configurations, or, supply a custom one to live-build, rather than
    partial/single files only.
  * Avoid creating old left-over directory for custom syslinux splash
    handing from within the config tree in lb_config.
  * Renaming config/binary_rootfs to simply config/rootfs.
