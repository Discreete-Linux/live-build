.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlb config\fR is a high\-level command (porcelain) of \fIlive\-build\fR(7), the live systems tool suite.
.PP
.\" FIXME
\fBlb config\fR populates the configuration directory for live\-build. By default, this directory is named 'config' and is created in the current directory where \fBlb config\fR was executed.
.PP
Note: Currently \fBlb config\fR tries to be smart and sets defaults for some options depending on the setting of other options (e.g. which linux packages to be used depending on if a wheezy system gets build or not). This means that when generating a new configuration, you should call \fBlb config\fR only once with all options specified. Calling it several times with only a subset of the options each can result in non working configurations. This is also caused by the fact that \fBlb config\fR called with one option only changes that option, and leaves everything else as is unless its not defined. However, \fBlb config\fR does warn about know impossible or likely impossible combinations that would lead to non working live systems. If unsure, remove config/{binary,bootstrap,chroot,common,source} and call \fBlb config\fR again.
.\" FIXME

.SH OPTIONS
In addition to its specific options \fBlb config\fR understands all generic live\-build options. See \fIlive\-build\fR(7) for a complete list of all generic live\-build options.
.PP
.\" FIXME
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\fR apt|aptitude" 4
defines if apt\-get or aptitude is used to install packages when building the image. The default is apt.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-ftp\-proxy\fR \fIURL\fR" 4
sets the ftp proxy to be used by apt. By default, this is empty. Note that this variable is only for the proxy that gets used by apt internally within the chroot, it is not used for anything else.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-http\-proxy\fR \fIURL\fR" 4
sets the http proxy to be used by apt. By default, this is empty. Note that this variable is only for the proxy that gets used by apt internally within the chroot, it is not used for anything else.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-indices\fR true|false|none" 4
defines if the resulting images should have apt indices or not and defaults to true. If set to none, no indices are included at all.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-options\fR \fIOPTION\fR|""\fIOPTIONS\fR""" 4
defines the default options that will be appended to every apt call that is made inside chroot during the building of the image. By default, this is set to \-\-yes to allow non-interactive installation of packages.
.IP "\fB\-\-aptitude\-options\fR \fIOPTION\fR|""\fIOPTIONS\fR""" 4
defines the default options that will be appended to every aptitude call that is made inside chroot during building of the image. By default, this is set to \-\-assume\-yes to allow non-interactive installation of packages.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-pipeline\fR \fIDEPTH\fR" 4
sets the depth of the apt/aptitude pipeline. In cases where the remote server is not RFC conforming or buggy (such as Squid 2.0.2) this option can be a value from 0 to 5 indicating how many outstanding requests APT should send. A value of zero MUST be specified if the remote host does not properly linger on TCP connections \- otherwise data corruption will occur. Hosts which require this are in violation of RFC 2068. By default, live\-build does not set this option.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-recommends\fR true|false" 4
defines if apt should install recommended packages automatically. By default, this is true.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-secure\fR true|false" 4
defines if apt should check repository signatures. This is true by default.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-source\-archives\fR true|false" 4
defines if deb-src entries should be included in the resulting live image or not, defaults to true.
.IP "\-a|\fB\-\-architectures\fR \fIARCHITECTURE\fR" 4
defines the architecture of the to be build image. By default, this is set to the host architecture. Note that you cannot crossbuild for another architecture if your host system is not able to execute binaries for the target architecture natively. For example, building amd64 images on i386 and vice versa is possible if you have a 64bit capable i386 processor and the right kernel. But building powerpc images on an i386 system is not possible.
.IP "\-b|\fB\-\-binary\-images\fR iso|iso\-hybrid|netboot|tar|hdd" 4
defines the image type to build. By default, for images using syslinux this is set to iso\-hybrid to build CD/DVD images that may also be used like hdd images, for non\-syslinux images, it defaults to iso.
.IP "\fB\-\-binary\-filesystem\fR fat16|fat32|ext2|ext3|ext4" 4
defines the filesystem to be used in the image type. This only has an effect if the selected binary image type does allow to choose a filesystem. For example, when selection iso the resulting CD/DVD has always the filesystem ISO9660. When building hdd images for usb sticks, this is active. Note that it defaults to fat16 on all architectures except sparc where it defaults to ext4. Also note that if you choose fat16 and your resulting binary image gets bigger than 2GB, the binary filesystem automatically gets switched to fat32.
.IP "\fB\-\-bootappend\-install\fR \fIPARAMETER\fR|""\fIPARAMETERS\fR""" 4
sets boot parameters specific to debian\-installer, if included.
.IP "\fB\-\-bootappend\-live\fR \fIPARAMETER\fR|""\fIPARAMETERS\fR""" 4
sets boot parameters specific to debian\-live. A complete list of boot parameters can be found in the \fIlive\-boot\fR(7) and \fIlive\-config\fR(7) manual pages.
.IP "\fB\-\-bootloader\fR grub|grub2|syslinux|grub-efi" 4
defines which bootloader is being used in the generated image. This has only an effect if the selected binary image type does allow to choose the bootloader. For example, if you build a iso, always syslinux (or more precise, isolinux) is being used. Also note that some combinations of binary images types and bootloaders may be possible but live\-build does not support them yet. \fBlb config\fR will fail to create such a not yet supported configuration and give a explanation about it. For hdd images on amd64 and i386, the default is syslinux.
.IP "\fB\-\-cache\fR true|false" 4
defines globally if any cache should be used at all. Different caches can be controlled through the their own options.
.IP "\fB\-\-cache\-indices\fR true|false" 4
defines if downloaded package indices and lists should be cached which is false by default. Enabling it would allow to rebuild an image completely offline, however, you would not get updates anymore then.
.IP "\fB\-\-cache\-packages\fR true|false" 4
defines if downloaded packages files should be cached which is true by default. Disabling it does save space consumption in your build directory, but remember that you will cause much unnecessary traffic if you do a couple of rebuilds. In general you should always leave it true, however, in some particular rare build setups, it can be faster to refetch packages from the local network mirror rather than to utilize the local disk.
.IP "\fB\-\-cache\-stages\fR true|false|\fISTAGE\fR|""\fISTAGES\fR""" 4
sets which stages should be cached. By default set to bootstrap. As an exception to the normal stage names, also rootfs can be used here which does only cache the generated root filesystem in filesystem.{dir,ext*,squashfs}. This is useful during development if you want to rebuild the binary stage but not regenerate the root filesystem all the time.
.IP "\fB\-\-checksums\fR md5|sha1|sha256|none" 4
defines if the binary image should contain a file called md5sums.txt, sha1sums.txt and/or sha256sums.txt. These lists all files on the image together with their checksums. This in turn can be used by live\-boot's built\-in integrity\-check to verify the medium if specified at boot prompt. In general, this should not be false and is an important feature of live system released to the public. However, during development of very big images it can save some time by not calculating the checksums.
.IP "\fB\-\-compression\fR bzip2|gzip|lzip|none" 4
defines the compression program to be used to compress tarballs. Defaults to gzip.
.IP "\fB\-\-config\fR \fIGIT_URL\fR::\fIGIT_ID\fR" 4
allows to bootstrap a config tree from a git repositories, optionally appended by a Git Id (branch, commit, tag, etc.).
.IP "\fB\-\-build\-with\-chroot\fR true|false" 4
defines whether live\-build should use the tools from within the chroot to build the binary image or not by using and including the host system's tools. This is a very dangerous option, using the tools of the host system can lead to tainted and even non-bootable images if the host systems version of the required tools (mainly these are the bootloaders such as syslinux and grub, and the auxiliary tools such as dosfstools, xorriso, squashfs-tools and others) do not \fBexactly\fR match what is present at build-time in the target distribution. Never do disable this option unless you are \fBexactly\fR sure what you are doing and have \fBcompletely\fI understood its consequences.
.IP "\fB\-\-chroot\-filesystem\fR ext2|ext3|ext4|squashfs|jffs2|none" 4
defines which filesystem type should be used for the root filesystem image. If you use none, then no filesystem image is created and the root filesystem content is copied on the binary image filesystem as flat files. Depending on what binary filesystem you have chosen, it may not be possible to build with such a plain root filesystem, e.g. fat16/fat32 will not work as linux does not support to run directly on them.
.IP "\fB\-\-clean\fR" 4
minimizes config directory by automatically removing unused and thus empty subdirectories.
.IP "\-c|\fB\-\-conffile\fR \fIFILE\fR" 4
using a user specified alternative configuration file in addition to the normally used one in the config directory.
.IP "\fB\-\-debconf\-frontend\fR dialog|editor|noninteractive|readline" 4
defines what value the debconf frontend should be set to inside the chroot. Note that setting it to anything but noninteractive, which is the default, makes your build asking questions during the build.
.IP "\fB\-\-debconf\-priority\fR low|medium|high|critical" 4
defines what value the debconf priority should be set to inside the chroot. By default, it is set to critical, which means that almost no questions are displayed. Note that this only has an effect if you use any debconf frontend different from noninteractive.
.IP "\fB\-\-debian\-installer\fR true|cdrom|netinst|netboot|businesscard|live|false" 4
defines which type, if any, of the debian\-installer should be included in the resulting binary image. By default, no installer is included. All available flavours except live are the identical configurations used on the installer media produced by regular debian\-cd. When live is chosen, the live\-installer udeb is included so that debian\-installer will behave different than usual \- instead of installing the debian system from packages from the medium or the network, it installs the live system to the disk.
.IP "\fB\-\-debian\-installer\-distribution\fR daily|\fICODENAME\fR" 4
defines the distribution where the debian\-installer files should be taken out from. Normally, this should be set to the same distribution as the live system. However, some times, one wants to use a newer or even daily built installer.
.IP "\fB\-\-debian\-installer\-preseedfile\fR \fIFILE\fR|\fIURL\fR" 4
sets the filename or URL for an optionally used and included preseeding file for debian\-installer. If config/binary_debian\-installer/preseed.cfg exists, it will be used by default. 
.IP "\fB\-\-debian\-installer\-gui\fR true|false" 4
defines if the debian\-installer graphical GTK interface should be true or not. In Debian mode and for most versions of Ubuntu, this option is true, whereas otherwise false, by default.
.IP "\fB\-\-debug\fR" 4
turn on debugging informational messages.
.IP "\-d|\fB\-\-distribution\fR \fICODENAME\fR" 4
defines the distribution of the resulting live system.
.IP "\-d|\fB\-\-parent\-distribution\fR \fICODENAME\fR" 4
defines the parent distribution for derivatives of the resulting live system.
.IP "\-d|\fB\-\-parent\-debian\-installer\-distribution\fR \fICODENAME\fR" 4
defines the parent debian\-installer distribution for derivatives of the resulting live system.
.IP "\fB\-\-dump\fR" 4
prepares a report of the currently present live system configuration and the version of live\-build used. This is useful to provide if you submit bug reports, we do get all informations required for us to locate and replicate an error.
.IP "\fB\-\-fdisk\fR fdisk|fdisk.dist" 4
sets the filename of the fdisk binary from the host system that should be used. This is autodetected and does generally not need any customization.
.IP "\fB\-\-force\fR" 4
forces re\-execution of already run stages. Use only if you know what you are doing. It is generally safer to use \fBlb clean\fR to clean up before re\-executing \fBlb build\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-grub\-splash\fR \fIFILE\fR" 4
defines the name of an optional to be included splash screen graphic for the grub bootloader.
.IP "\fB\-\-gzip\-options\fR \fIOPTION\fR|""\fIOPTIONS\fR""" 4
defines the default options that will be appended to (almost) every gzip call during the building of the image. By default, this is set to \-\-best to use highest (but slowest) compression. Dynamically, if the host system supports it, also \-\-rsyncable is added.
.IP "\fB\-\-hooks\fR \fIFILE\fR" 4
defines which hooks available in /usr/share/live/build/examples/hooks should be activated. Normally, there are no hooks executed. Make sure you know and understood the hook before you enable it.
.IP "\fB\-\-ignore\-system\-defaults\fR" 4
\fBlb config\fR by default reads system defaults from \fI/etc/live/build.conf\fR and \fI/etc/live/build/*\fR when generating a new live system config directory. This is useful if you want to set global settings, such as mirror locations, and don't want to specify them all of the time.
.IP "\fB\-\-initramfs\fR auto|none|live\-boot|casper" 4
sets the name of package that contains the live system specific initramfs modification. By default, auto is used, which means that at build time of the image rather than on configuration time, the value will be expanded to casper when building ubuntu systems, to live\-boot for all other systems. Using 'none' is useful if the resulting system image should not be a live image (experimental).
.IP "\fB\-\-initramfs\-compression\fR bzip2|gzip|lzma]
defines the compression program to be used to compress the initramfs. Defaults to gzip.
.IP "\fB\-\-interactive\fR shell" 4
defines if after the chroot stage and before the beginning of the binary stage, a interactive shell login should be spawned in the chroot in order to allow you to do manual customizations. Once you close the shell with logout or exit, the build will continue as usual. Note that it's strongly discouraged to use this for anything else than testing. Modifications that should be present in all builds of a live system should be properly made through hooks. Everything else destroys the beauty of being able to completely automatise the build process and making it non interactive. By default, this is of course false.
.IP "\fB\-\-isohybrid\-options\fR \fIOPTION\fR|""\fIOPTIONS\fR""" 4
defines options to pass to isohybrid.
.IP "\fB\-\-iso\-application\fR \fINAME\fR" 4
sets the APPLICATION field in the header of a resulting CD/DVD image and defaults to "Debian Live" in debian mode, and "Ubuntu Live" in ubuntu mode.
.IP "\fB\-\-iso\-preparer\fR \fINAME\fR" 4
sets the PREPARER field in the header of a resulting CD/DVD image. By default this is set to "live\-build \fIVERSION\fR; http://packages.qa.debian.org/live\-build", where VERSION is expanded to the version of live\-build that was used to build the image.
.IP "\fB\-\-iso\-publisher\fR \fINAME\fR" 4
sets the PUBLISHED field in the header of a resulting CD/DVD image. By default, this is set to 'Live Systems project; http:/live-systems.org/; debian\-live@lists.debian.org'. Remember to change this to the appropriate values at latest when you distributing custom and unofficial images.
.IP "\fB\-\-iso\-volume\fR \fINAME\fR" 4
sets the VOLUME field in the header of a resulting CD/DVD and defaults to '(\fIMODE\fR) (\fIDISTRIBUTION\fR) (\fIDATE\fR)' whereas MODE is expanded to the name of the mode in use, DISTRIBUTION the distribution name, and DATE with the current date and time of the generation.
.IP "\fB\-\-jffs2\-eraseblock\fR \fISIZE\fR" 4
sets the eraseblock size for a JFFS2 (Second Journaling Flash File System) filesystem. The default is 64 KiB. If you use an erase block size different than the erase block size of the target MTD device, JFFS2 may not perform optimally. If the SIZE specified is below 4096, the units are assumed to be KiB.
.IP "\fB\-\-keyring\-packages\fR \fIPACKAGE\fI|""\fIPACKAGES\fR""" 4
sets the keyring package or additional keyring packages. By default this is set to debian\-archive\-keyring.
.IP "\-k|\fB\-\-linux\-flavours\fR \fIFLAVOUR\fR|""\fIFLAVOURS\fR""" 4
sets the kernel flavours to be installed. Note that in case you specify more than that the first will be configured the default kernel that gets booted.
.IP "\fB\-\-linux\-packages\fR ""\fIPACKAGES\fR""" 4
sets the internal name of the kernel packages naming scheme. If you use debian kernel packages, you will not have to adjust it. If you decide to use custom kernel packages that do not follow the debian naming scheme, remember to set this option to the stub of the packages only (for debian this is linux\-image\-2.6), so that \fISTUB\fR-\fIFLAVOUR\fR results in a valid package name (for debian e.g. linux\-image\-686\-pae). Preferably you use the meta package name, if any, for the stub, so that your configuration is ABI independent. Also don't forget that you have to include stubs of the binary modules packages for unionfs or aufs, and squashfs if you built them out-of-tree.
.IP "\fB\-\-losetup\fR losetup|losetup.orig" 4
sets the filename of the losetup binary from the host system that should be used. This is autodetected and does generally not need any customization.
.IP "\fB\-\-memtest\fR memtest86+|memtest86|none" 4
defines if memtest, memtest86+ or no memory tester at all should be included as secondary bootloader configuration. This is only available on amd64 and i386 and defaults to memtest86+.
.IP "\-m|\fB\-\-parent\-mirror\-bootstrap\fR \fIURL\fR" 4
sets the location of the debian package mirror that should be used to bootstrap from. This defaults to http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ which may not be a good default if you live outside of Europe.
.IP "\fB\-\-parent\-mirror\-chroot\fR \fIURL\fR" 4
sets the location of the debian package mirror that will be used to fetch the packages in order to build the live system. By default, this is set to the value of \-\-parent\-mirror\-bootstrap.

.IP "\fB\-\-net\-cow\-path\fR \fIPATH\fR" 4
defines the path to client writable filesystem. Anywhere that \fIclient_mac_address\fR is specified in the path live\-boot will substitute the MAC address of the client delimited with hyphens.
.PP
.IP "" 4
Example:
.br
/export/hosts/client_mac_address
.br
/export/hosts/00\-16\-D3\-33\-92\-E8
.IP "\fB\-\-net\-cow\-server\fR \fIIP\fR|\fIHOSTNAME\fR" 4
sets the IP or hostname that will be configured in the bootloader configuration for the copy\-on\-write filesystem of your netboot image and is by default empty.
.IP "\fB\-\-net\-tarball\fR true|false" 4
defines if a compressed tarball should be created. Disabling this options leads to no tarball at all, the plain binary directory is considered the output in this case. Default is true.
.IP "\fB\-\-quiet\fR" 4
reduces the verbosity of messages output by \fBlb build\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-archive\-areas\fR \fIARCHIVE_AREA\fR|""\fIARCHIVE_AREAS\fR""" 4
defines which package archive areas of a debian packages archive should be used for configured debian package mirrors. By default, this is set to main. Remember to check the licenses of each packages with respect to their redistributability in your juristiction when enabling contrib or non\-free with this mechanism.
.IP "\fB\-\-parent\-archive\-areas\fR \fIPARENT_ARCHIVE_AREA\fR|""\fIPARENT_ARCHIVE_AREAS\fR""" 4
defines the archive areas for derivatives of the resulting live system.
.IP "\fB\-\-security\fR true|false" 4
defines if the security repositories specified in the security mirror options should be used or not.
.IP "\fB\-\-source\fR true|false" 4
defines if a corresponding source image to the binary image should be build. By default this is false because most people do not require this and would require to download quite a few source packages. However, once you start distributing your live image, you should make sure you build it with a source image alongside.
.IP "\-s|\fB\-\-source\-images\fR iso|netboot|tar|hdd" 4
defines the image type for the source image. Default is tar.
.IP "\fB\-\-firmware\-binary\fR true|false" 4
defines if firmware packages should be automatically included into the binary pool for debian\-installer. Note that only firmware packages available within the configured archive areas are included, e.g. an image with packages from main only will not automatically include firmware from non\-free. This option does not interfere with explicitly listed packages in binary package lists.
.IP "\fB\-\-firmware\-chroot\fR true|false" 4
defines if firmware packages should be automatically included into the live image. Note that only firmware packages available within the configured archive areas are included, e.g. an image with packages from main only will not automatically include firmware from non\-free. This option does not interfere with explicitly listed packages in chroot package lists.
.IP "\fB\-\-swap\-file\-path\fR \fIPATH\fR" 4
defines the path to a swap file to create in the binary image. Default is not to create a swap file.
.IP "\fB\-\-swap\-file\-size\fR \fIMB\fR" 4
defines what size in megabytes the swap file should be, if one is to be created. Default is 512MB.
.IP "\fB\-\-tasksel\fR apt|aptitude|tasksel" 4

.IP "\fB\-\-templates\fR \fIPATH\fR" 4
sets the path to the templates that live\-build is going to use, e.g. for bootloaders. By default, this is set to /usr/share/live/build/templates/.
.IP "\fB\-\-hdd\-size\fR MB" 4
defines what size the hdd image should be. Note that although the default is set to 10000 (= 10GB), it will not need 10GB space on your harddisk as the files are created as sparse files.
.IP "\fB\-\-updates\fR true|false" 4
defines if debian updates package archives should be included in the image or not.
.IP "\fB\-\-backports\fR true|false" 4
defines if debian backports package archives should be included in the image or not.
.IP "\fB\-\-verbose\fR" 4
increases the verbosity of messages output by \fBlb build\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-win32\-loader true|false" 4
defines if win32\-loader should be included in the binary image or not.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.\" FIXME
Currently, command line switches can also be specified through the corresponding environment variable. However, this generally should not be relied upon, as it is an implementation detail that is subject to change in future releases. For options applying directly to live\-build, environment variables are named LB_FOO, meaning, e.g. \fB\-\-apt\-ftp\-proxy\fR becomes LB_APT_FTP_PROXY (the exception being internal options such as \fB\-\-debug\fR). For options passed to another program, as in APT_OPTIONS or GZIP_OPTIONS, no LB_ prefix is used.

.IP "\fBauto/config\fR" 4
.IP "\fB/etc/live/build.conf, /etc/live/build/*\fR" 4
An optional, global configuration file for \fBlb config\fR variables. It is useful to specify a few system wide defaults, like LB_PARENT_MIRROR_BOOTSTRAP. This feature can be false by specifying the \fB\-\-ignore\-system\-defaults\fR option.
